<p style="font-size: 18px; color: black;">**Why should we consider switching from Outlook to Front:**</p><br>

## What is Front?

Front is a modern customer service platform that helps companies enhance customer experiences, engage their teams, and build stronger businesses. It provides a seamless way to manage communication across various channels, including email, social media, and more. Here are some key points about [Front](www.front.com)<br><br>

### Views and Accountability ‚öñÔ∏èÔ∏è

Outlook‚Äôs shared mailboxes and distribution lists lack clear ownership, leading to confusion about who should handle specific emails.
Front provides shared inboxes, allowing your team to collaborate effectively. Real-time collision detection ensures everyone knows who‚Äôs responding to an email, eliminating duplicate work and ensuring accountability.<br><br>

### Avoid Lost Emails üß≠

In Outlook, valuable emails can get lost in the flood of incoming messages.
Front keeps your team on top of messages, ensuring faster responses and critical communication doesn‚Äôt slip through the cracks.<br><br>

### Metrics Tracking ‚è±Ô∏è

Outlook lacks built-in features for tracking metrics like response times and SLA agreements.
Front offers reporting and analytics, allowing you to monitor performance, measure response times, and meet service level agreements effectively.<br><br>
